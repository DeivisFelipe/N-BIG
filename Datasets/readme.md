# 📁 Datasets

This folder contains the datasets used for network traffic analysis in this project.  
You should place here the processed `.txt` files (where each line represents a network flow extracted from a PCAP).

- Example:
  - `CAIDA/caida01.txt`
  - `MAWI/mawi01.txt`

> **Note:** The `.txt` files are generated by processing the PCAP files using the flow extraction tool described in the main README.
